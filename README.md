# Understanding The Order of Execution On SQL


SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful language used to query and manipulate data in relational database management systems. SQL statements are written as `SELECT ‚Ä¶ FROM ‚Ä¶ WHERE ‚Ä¶`, but executed helps you **filter**, **group**, and **sort data correctly ‚Äî and optimize** your queries effectively.

## üîÑ 1. Real Execution Flow

| Step | Clause | Description |
|------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **1** | `FROM` | Identify the source table(s), including any `JOIN` operations. |
| **2** | `WHERE` | Filter rows based on the specified condition. |
| **3** | `GROUP BY` | Group rows based on one or more columns, usually for aggregation. |
| **4** | `HAVING` | Filter the resulting groups based on a condition. |
| **5** | `SELECT` | Select the columns to return, including expressions or aggregates. |
| **6** | `DISTINCT` | Remove duplicate rows |
| **7** | `UNION` / `UNION ALL` | Combine results from multiple queries |
| **8** | `ORDER BY` | Sort the results by one or more columns. |
| **9** | `LIMIT` / `OFFSET` | Return a subset of rows |

> *Note*: Some databases evaluate **window functions** right after `SELECT` and before `DISTINCT`.

## üîÑ 2. Window Functions

A **window function** performs calculations across a set of rows (a ‚Äúwindow‚Äù) that are related to the current row. Unlike aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, etc.) that collapse rows, window functions **retain individual rows** while adding analytical results.
### üîπ Syntax
```sql
<function>(<expression>) OVER (
    PARTITION BY <column>
    ORDER BY <column>
    ROWS BETWEEN ... AND ...
 )

## ü§î 2. Why is the function written first but the engine reads differently?

SQL is a **declarative language**: you describe *what* result you want, not *how* to compute it.

When the database runs your query:
- It needs to **access the data first** (`FROM`)  
- Then **filter** it (`WHERE`)  
- Then **group or aggregate**,  
- Before it can **return or calculate** anything in the `SELECT`.

So even though `SELECT` is written first, the **engine executes `FROM` first** under the hood.

## üìå 3. Example Query

# Minimal SQL Example ‚Äì Whole‚ÄêKernel Yield 

This snippet shows how to calculate **% Whole** for each production line on a given day using just two arithmetic formulas and the basic SQL clauses covered in class.

## SQL Script

```sql
/* Goal: compute %Whole per line for a single production date */
SELECT
    prod_date,                       -- production date
    line_id,                         -- line identifier
    SUM(kernel_g) AS kernel_g,       -- total kernel weight (g)
    SUM(whole_g)  AS whole_g,        -- total whole-kernel weight (g)
    SUM(whole_g) / SUM(kernel_g) AS pct_whole   -- ‚ë¢ %Whole
FROM (
    /* 1Ô∏è‚É£  Row-level calculations (two formulas) */
    SELECT
        prod_date,
        line_id,
        -- ‚ë† kernel_g = sample_weight √ó (100 ‚àí shell_pct) / 100
        sample_weight * (100 - shell_pct) / 100.0          AS kernel_g,
        -- ‚ë° whole_g  = kernel_g √ó whole_pct / 100
        sample_weight * (100 - shell_pct) / 100.0
            * whole_pct / 100.0                            AS whole_g
    FROM quality_data
) AS t
GROUP BY
    prod_date,
    line_id
ORDER BY
    prod_date,
    line_id;


## Logical Execution Order

1. **FROM `quality_data`** ‚Äì read the base table.  
2. **Column arithmetic** ‚Äì calculate `kernel_g` and `whole_g` for each row (two formulas).  
3. The sub-query becomes temporary table **`t`**.  
4. **GROUP BY `prod_date`, `line_id`** ‚Äì aggregate rows per date and line.  
5. **SELECT** ‚Äì return summed grams and compute `pct_whole`.  
6. **ORDER BY** ‚Äì sort the final result.
